# üîß Network Conflict Fix Summary

## ‚ùå **Problem:** 
Network `shopsphere-build_shopsphere-network` was conflicting with existing Docker networks causing:
```
failed to create network shopsphere-build_shopsphere-network: Error response from daemon: invalid pool request: Pool overlaps with other one on this address space
```

## ‚úÖ **Solution Applied:**

### 1. **Unique Test Networks:**
- Changed from static network name to dynamic: `shopsphere-test-${BUILD_NUMBER}`
- Each build gets its own isolated network
- No more conflicts with existing networks

### 2. **Dedicated Test Docker Compose:**
- Created `docker-compose.test.yml` dynamically for each build
- Uses unique container names: `test-backend-${BUILD_NUMBER}`, `test-frontend-${BUILD_NUMBER}`
- Isolated test network: `test-network-${BUILD_NUMBER}`

### 3. **Enhanced Cleanup:**
- Removes test containers by specific names
- Cleans up test networks after each build
- Removes temporary docker-compose.test.yml file

### 4. **Frontend Memory Optimization:**
- **8GB Memory**: `NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=8192`
- **Docker Build**: `--memory=4g --memory-swap=8g`
- **Container Resources**: 4G memory, 2 CPUs

## üöÄ **Result:**
- **No Network Conflicts** ‚úÖ
- **Isolated Test Environment** ‚úÖ  
- **8GB Memory for Frontend** ‚úÖ
- **Proper Cleanup** ‚úÖ

Build #33 should now run successfully without network conflicts!
